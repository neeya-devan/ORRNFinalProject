# Development Log (Date: 10/28/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals

Forming team goals, developing a productive team contract, drafting a final project proposal,setting up a development workspace on VSCode and Docker, and selecting the data set and algorithms we want to use.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Oju - Drafting final project proposal

Ria - Set up GitHub repository

Rucha - Setting up development log

Neeya - Updating team contract

## Problems Encountered 
 Oju - Indecisive on which datasets to use in order to most appropriately and effectively answer our proposed question.
 
 Ria - no problems encountered
 
 Rucha - no problems encountered
 
 Neeya - no problems encountered

## Plans for next week
Load our selected data files as a graph and be able to use that graph to run a find person traversal algorithm on the file

# Development Log (Date: 11/07/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week was to interpret the data files we were given and pick with files we actually need to construct the graph. We also wanted to read the data from the file to create an adjacency matrix represention of the graph and implement BFS for the graph. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Since this weeks tasks were fundamental to the start of the project we each task together.

Neeya --> Interpret the data, started constructing adjacency matrix graph, implemented BFS.

Oju --> Interpret the data, started constructing adjacency matrix graph, implemented BFS, revised Project Proposal.

Rucha --> Interpret the data, started constructing adjacency matrix graph, implemented BFS.

Ria --> Interpret the data, started constructing adjacency matrix graph, implemented BFS.

## Problems Encountered 

While reading our csv file of all the edges in our graph
we have been unsuccesful in splitting up the nodes and finishing our implementation of the graph. Due to this, we also have not been able to test that our BFS works since we don't have a completed graph to run through the method. 

## Plans for next week

Next week we plan to debug our graph implementation and implement Prim’s MST and start coding our A* search method as well.

# Development Log (Date: 11/14/22 -- 11/18/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week was to code the Prim's MST algorithm for our undirected and unweighted graph and alter our adjacency matrix in order to correclty reflect the algorithm as well.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Neeya --> Implemented Prim's MST which uses a BFS and shortest path traversal.

Oju --> Implemented Prim's MST which uses a BFS and shortest path traversal.

Rucha --> Implemented Prim's MST which uses a BFS and shortest path traversal.

Ria --> Implemented Prim's MST which uses a BFS and shortest path traversal.


## Problems Encountered 

Since Prim's MST algorithm is used on weighted and undirected graphs, it was challenging adding weights of 1 to our unweighted adjacency matrix in order to properly traverse through it. Due to this, we are still debugging our MST implementation.

## Plans for next week

Next week we plan to effectively debug our Prim's MST implementation and start coding A* algorithm as well.

# Development Log (Date: 11/28/22 -- 12/02/22)

## Weekly Goals: Our goal for this week was to finish implementing A* and start some of the aspects of the final project.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Ria: Started working on the updated ReadME for our project. She added the instructions for how to compile and test out code.

Oju: Researched A* algorithm and updated previosu code so that it was compatible with the A* method. Also researched helper methods for A*.

Rucha: Researched A* algorithm and updated previosu code so that it was compatible with the A* method. Also researched helper methods for A*.

Neeya: Worked on more test cases for algorithms such as Prim’s and cleaned up code to prepare it for the final presentation. 

## Problems Encountered 

We are still figuring out how to use A* Search on our adjacency matrix. We need to update our graph weights. Otherwise, there were no issues.

## Plans for next week
In the next week we will complete the project by finishing A* and creating the video for our final project deliverables.
