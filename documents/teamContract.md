# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** We plan to meet every Monday and Wedneaday from 2-3pm to work on our project. As of right now, we plan to meet in person so we will not use software to host the meetings. During the meeting we plan to all take notes on our individual work as well as on our overall project.

2. **Assistance** We all have each other's phone number and have a group chat that we will contact whenever we need help. We know everyone has busy days at times but we plan to respond to each other's messages as soon as we see them, but at the latest by the end of the day.

3. **Respect** We all value each other's idea deeply and plan to let each other speak wihtout interrupting them until they are done sharing their insights. We will also refrain from making any larger decisions about the project without consulting everyone's opinon first, that way each group memeber has an equal say in the project.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** Since we are a group of four, and we are planning to have a few methods, we are going to work in pairs to complete each method.  Each week we will evaluate where everyone is at with their individual tasks. After doing so, we can rearrange the pairs so that everyone is doing work and so that anyone who is sturggling on tehir part will get help from the other group members.

5. **Time Commitment** Each group memeber will have a 3 hour time commitment for the project. Two of the hours will be during our scheduled group meeting time and then an hour of work will be for individual time to finish up the tasks that we need to finish by the end of the week.

6. **Conflict Resolution** Our team will resolve disagreements between memebers by talking about it openly so that it does not get in the way of the completion of our project and our positive work environment. In situations where one or more members have not finished their tasks we will talk to them about why they were unable to do so and first see if there is a way for us to support them so that it is possible for them to complete the task. In situations where one or more members are habitually late we will just ask them to try to be on time next time.
